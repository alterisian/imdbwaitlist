## Running Locally

To run the app on your local machine:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```

2. Start the server directly with Ruby:
   ```
   ruby app.rb
   ```
   This will start the Sinatra app on `localhost:4567` by default.

## Deploying to Fly.io

Fly.io uses a `config.ru` file and runs the app with `rackup`.  
When deployed, Fly.io will start the server using:

```
bundle exec rackup --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**Note:**  
- Ensure you have a `config.ru` file in your project root with the following content:
  ```ruby
  require './app'
  run Sinatra::Application
  ```
- The server will listen on port `8080` as required by Fly.io.
